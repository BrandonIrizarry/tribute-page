      I decided to design my <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> Tribute Page
      around
      the Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup, the original
      designer and implementer of C++. C++ is arguably one of the most influential
      computer languages that have ever been designed: according to the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++ Wikipedia page</a>, it has influenced the design of Python,
      Java,
      Rust, and even C99 (a version of C that had come after C++). It also boasts ubiquitous industrial applications.

      Piggybacking off of the elegance
      and efficiency of the C programming language, C++ is truly a one-of-a-kind product: it
      is a meeting place of expressivity and efficiency.

      Stroustrup maintains an interesting presence on the Web via <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.stroustrup.com"
        target="_blank">his personal webpage</a>. Here's a quick timeline of
      Stroustrup's accomplishments:
      <ul id="list">
        <li>
          Born December 30, 1950, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aarhus">Aarhus, Denmark</a>
        </li>
        <li>Attended Aarhus University 1969–1975 and graduated with the Danish equivalent of a good master's degree in
          mathematics and computer science.
        </li>
        <li>Received in 1979 a PhD in computer science from the University of Cambridge, for a thesis on communication
          in distributed computing systems. He was supervised by
          David Wheeler.
          <br><br>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wheeler_(computer_scientist)">David Wheeler</a> is
          considered a co-inventor of the subroutine technique in computer programming, something we all but take as
          an
          elementary principle for quite some time now.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also in 1979, joins the technical staff at the Bell Labs Computer Science Research Center, the famous
          birthplace
          of C and UNIX.

          There, he began his work on C++ and programming techniques.
        </li>
        <li>
          From 2002 to 2014, Stroustrup was the College of Engineering Chair Professor in Computer Science at Texas
          A&M
          University. From 2011, he was made a University Distinguished Professor.
        </li>
        <li>
          As of January 2014, Stroustrup is a technical fellow and managing director in the technology division of
          Morgan
          Stanley in New York City and a visiting professor in computer science at Columbia University.
